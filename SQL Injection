SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.

SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.
Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a select string. The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString):
Example
==============
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;

SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True. Eg:- (SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;) ==> Always True.
SQL Injection Based on ""="" is Always True Eg:- (SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="" or ""="" AND Pass ="" or ""="") ==> Always True
